            <p>Enid Blyton is my favourite author. I have read almost all her books. She is a very talented childrens' writer. Though she might repeat her ideas as seen in Famous Five and Secret Seven or Malory Towers and St.Clare's, she is still my favourite author and the best. She has books in almost all catogories- mystery, fiction, non-fiction, fantasy etc. I stay up all night reading her books because reader's are captivated by her mystery and have to just complete the book. I suggest all of you should give her book a try!!!</p>
